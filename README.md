Just copy text and execute the program. If you have xclip installed, you can just select the text instead of copying it.
I myself created a shortcut to execute the program, and I would suggest people to do the same if they want to experience the complete ease.
Execute `pyspritz -h` to print the usage.
Requires pygame and optionally xclip. Written for python2 and python3.

Start with executing `python pyspritz -f 50 -s -g 22` and adjust to your liking.
