# pythonspeedreader
A simple ugly speed reader. I wrote it because there was no decent speed reader available for Linux. The other speed readers were embedded in a browser. They also had some lag.

Just select text and execute the program. I myself created a shortcut for this on my keyboard.
Execute 'pyspritz -h' to print the usage.
Requires pygame and xclip. Written in python2.
