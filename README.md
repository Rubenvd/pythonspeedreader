# pythonspeedreader
A simple ugly speed reader using spritzlet method of speed reading. I wrote it because there was no decent speed reader available for Linux. The other speed readers were embedded in a browser. They also had some lag.

Left and right button change speed.

Pressing space will pause.

Requires pygame and xclip. Written in python2.
