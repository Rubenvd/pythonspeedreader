# pythonspeedreader
A simple ugly speed reader using spritzlet method of speed reading. I wrote it because there was no decent speed reader available for Linux. The other speed readers were embedded in a browser. They also had some lag.

Just select text and execute the program. I myself created a shortcut for this on my keyboard.
Left and right button change speed.
Pressing space will pause.

Requires pygame and xclip. Written in python2. Possibly it will fail because it can't find the ttf. Just adapt the script if so.
