# pythonspeedreader
A simple ugly speed reader using spritzlet method of speed reading. I wrote it because there was no decent speed reader available for Linux. The other speed readers were embedded in a browser. They also had some lag.

Just select text and execute the program. I myself created a shortcut for this on my keyboard.
Left and right button change speed.
Pressing space will pause.
Pressing U will decrease the font size.
Pressing I will increase the font size.
Pressing up will increase the amount of words displayed at once.
Pressing down will decrease the amount of words displayed at once.

Requires pygame and xclip. Written in python2.
